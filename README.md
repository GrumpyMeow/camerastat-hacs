# Camera Statistic
A HACS custom Home Assistant integration to get statistic from a camera image.
It uses the [ImageStat](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageStat.html) operation from Pillow.

I created this integration as i wanted to have automation switch from day <-> night mode. I was unable to get my camera to do this itself in a desired way.

This integration should also make it possible to check if your red ferrari is parked on your drive way.
